What it is?
A.	Lapindrome -
Step 1 : When String is divided into two halves and string contains in first halve matching with string contains in second halve then it is lapindrome.
Step 2: If String is odd in length then skip the middle character and do the Step 1 process.
Example : abab, abcab,wewe,weuwe, uvu, youryou,unmeunme.

B.	Palindrome -
When we reverse the String, if String is exact equal after reversing it, then it is Palindrome
Example : 121, 2225222, 33533.

C.	Factorial â€“
If we want factorial of 5 then answer is, 5*4*3*2*1 =120
If we want factorial of 6 then answer is, 6*5*4*3*2*1*=720
Like factorial of 7 is =5040 and 8 is= 40320

D.	Perfect Square root 
If square root value  is integer then it is perfect square root else it is not.
Example : 1. square root of 16 is 4 is integer. Its Perfect Square.
                  2. square root of 9 is 3 is Integer. Its Perfect Square.
                  3. square root of 5 is in decimal. So its not Perfect Square
                  4. square root of 11 is in decimal. So its not Perfect Square.

E.	   Prime number
	If Number is Divisible by Itself and 1, Then Its Prime number

F.	Fibonacci Series
Answer or value is a Sum of Previous Two Numbers.

G.	Leap year or not
Step 1: If year is divisible by 400 and remainder is 0. 
AND
Step 2: If year is divisible by 4 and remainder is 0 AND year divisible 100 not equal to 0. Then It is Leap Year else Its not a Leap year.
